Question 1: 
Peter is in jail and has 20 dollars; he can get out on bail if he has 64 dollars. A guard agrees to make a series of bets with him. If Peter bets A dollar, he wins A dollar with probability 0.55 and loses A dollar with probability 0.45.

Find the probability that he wins 8 dollars before losing all of his money if:
  a. he bets 5 dollars each time (timid strategy).
  
  q(z)=(1-(q/p)^i)/(1-(q/p)^N)

```{r}

i <- 5
N <- 8
p <- .55
q <- .45

result_timid <- (1-(q/p)^i) / (1-(q/p)^N)

result_timid

```
Therefore, the probability of Peter winning 8 dollars with a timid strategy is 0.7924987 or 79.2%


b. he bets, each time, as much as possible but not more than necessary to bring his fortune up to 64 dollars (bold strategy).

q0=0
q1=0.55(q2)+0.45(q0)
q2=0.55(q4)+0.45(q0)
q4=0.55(q8)+0.45(q0)
q8=1

```{r}
start_dollars <- 20
out_on_bail <- c()

for (j in 20:100000) {
  samples <- c(start_dollars)
  for (x in 20: 100) {
    samples <- append(samples, sample(c(sum(samples),-sum(samples)), size=20, replace=T, prob=c(.55,.45)))
    if (sum(samples) >= 64){
      out_on_bail <- append(out_on_bail, 1)
      break
    } else if (sum(samples) <= 0) {
      break
    }
  }
}  

sum(out_on_bail) / 100000

```
The probability of Peter winning with a bold strategy is 0.64394 or 64.39%


```{r}
q_0 <- 0
q_64 <- 20

q_4 <- 0.55*(q_64)+0.45*(q_0)
q_2 <- 0.55*(q_4)+0.45*(q_0)
result_bold <- 0.55*(q_2)+0.45*(q_0)

result_bold
```



c. Which strategy gives Smith the better chance of getting out of jail?

The timid strategy is better than the bold strategy, therefore Timid is the best strategy to use.


Question 2:
Derive the formulas for the Gambler’s Ruin Problem for situation when 𝑝 = 𝑞 and 𝑝 ≠ 𝑞. 

Answer: Consider Peter who starts with an intial luck of $$ $1$$ and then on each successive gamble he will either win$$  $1 $$ or loose $$ $1 $$ 

Therefore p stands for the probability of wining while q is the probability of loosing which is represented as $$ q=1-p $$


In general the idea is  $$ 0<i< N $$

While the game proceeds $$ {Rn: n>=0} $$ 

forms a random walk. 

$$Rn = ∆1 + · · · + ∆n, R0 = i,
 $$

Where $${∆1}$$ forms an i.i.d. sequence of r.v.s distributed as $$P(∆ = i) = p,    P(∆ = -1) =q=1-P$$

Let $$ Pi = min{n≥0: Rn Σ{0,N}|Ro = i$$

when either $$Rn = 0 (when the game stops)$$
gambler is ruined
or 
$$ Rn = N (when Peter wins)$$
$$Pi = PPi+1 + ΣPi-1$$
$$1≤i≤N-1$$
$$∆1 = 1 or ∆1 = -1$$
For $$ P+q=1 $$

$$PPi+Σpi = PPi+1 + qPi+1$$
$$=Pi+1 -Pi =q/p(Pi-Pi-1)$$

therefore, $$P2-Pi = (q/p)(P1-Po) = (q/p)P1 for Po=0$$

so: $$P3-P2 =(q/p)(P2-P1)=(q/p)^2$$

Generally, 

$$Pi+1 -Pi =(q/p)^i P1$$

$$0<i<N$$
Thus
$$Pi+1 -P1 = Σ^ik=1(Pk+1 -Pk)$$

$$Σ^ik=1(q/p)^kP1$$

Which gies $$Pi+1 = P1+P1Σ^ik=1(q/p)^k =PiΣ^ik=0(q/p)^k $$

$$ {P1 \frac {1-(q/p)^i+1}{1-q/p}  if P ≠ q
P1(i+1) if p =q=0.5} $$

Using geometric series equation 

$$Σ^in=o =\frac{1-a^(i+1)}{1-a} $$ 

for any a and integer i≥1

Choosing $$ i =N-1  
and PN=1 $$


$$1 =PN = {P1 \frac {1-(q/p)^N}{1-q/p}  if P ≠ q
1, N if p =q=0.5}$$

we therefore conclude 
$$P1 = {\frac {1-(q/p)}{1-q/p} , if P ≠ q
\frac{i}{N}, if p =q=0.5}$$


Please Note $$1-Pi$$ 

is the probability of ruin

Question 2b)
Also describe how to becoming infinitely rich or getting ruined in the same Gambler’s Ruin setting 

Answer
$$if P>0.5$$
then $$\frac {P}{q}<1$$
thus 
$$P1 = {\frac {1-(q/p)}{1-q/p} , if P ≠ q
\frac{i}{N}, if p =q=0.5}$$
No winning value in this case
$$ = lim Pi = 1-(\frac{q}{p})^i>0, P>0.5$$
No winning value in this case.Therefore he is in favor of winning
If $$P≤0.5, then \frac{q}{p}≥1$$
thus 
$$lim Pi=O, P≤0.5$$
Peter is not in favor of being ruined
$$N→∞$$
Therefore it means that P>0.5 is on Peter's favor 

Question 3:

Tom starts with $5, and p = 0.63: What is the probability that Tom obtains a fortune of N = 12 without going broke?


$$i=5,N=12 \text{ and } q=1-p=0.37$$
hence
$$\frac{q}{p}=\frac{37}{63}$$
$$P_2 = \frac{1-(37/63)^5}{1-(37/63)^{12}} = \frac{0.93012}{0.99832} = 0.9317$$


What is the probability that Tom will become infinitely rich? If Tom instead started with i = $2, what is the probability that he would go broke?

$$i =2 $$
$$(\frac{q}{p})^i = (\frac{37}{63})^2 = 0.3449$$
Question 5 

Collins bought a share of stock for $$$10$$, and it is believed that the stock price moves (day by day) as a simple random walk with p = 0.6. What is the probability that Collins’ stock reaches the high value of $$$25$$ before the low value of $$$4$$?

Answer 
a = 25
b = 4
p = 0.6
q = 0.4

$$ p(a) = (\frac{1-(\frac{q}{p})^b{1-(\frac{q}{p})^(a+b)})$$
```{r}
a <- 25
b <- 4
p <- 0.6
q <- 0.4

P <- (1-(q/p)^b)/(1 -(q/p)^(a+b))

P
```
